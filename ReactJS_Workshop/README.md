# ReactJS Workshop
The ReactJS code in this repository is from the workshop held during Hack Night on 02/10/2016 by ACM Hack. It is only a small taste of the true power of React - the hottest front-end JavaScript framework in the industry. Feel free to clone this repo or fork it to contribute to the project.

#Demo
You can see what we built in the workshop - [here](http://acm-react.herokuapp.com).

#Introduction
ReactJS is Facebook's answer to the short comings of current front-end JavaScript tools that employ the traditional MVC framework. Using JSX, React engineers can quickly write powerful and efficient apps that employ a uni-directional data flow. This tool revolutionizes UI development because it makes apps _simple_ and _dynamic_. For more information about React, check out the [presentation](https://github.com/epicchewy/ACM_Hack/blob/master/ReactJS_Workshop/Intro-to-React-JS.pdf) we gave at the workshop.

#Installation
To play around with the project on your own local setup, follow these steps:
+ Clone the repo onto your computer
+ Open Terminal/CMD Prompt and navigate to the directory
```
cd path/to/react/
```
+ Because of the project's dependencies, you have to run a local server to view the project.

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
+ In your browser, go to localhost:8000.

#Resources
